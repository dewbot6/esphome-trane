# esphome-trane

An [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) component for monitoring and controlling Trane HVAC systems that use the **ComfortLink II** communicating bus, enabling local control through Home Assistant without any cloud dependency.

Inspired by and structurally modeled after [esphome-econet](https://github.com/esphome-econet/esphome-econet).

---

## Overview

Trane ComfortLink II systems communicate over a proprietary 50kbps CAN bus connecting the thermostat, SC360 zone controller, air handler, and outdoor unit. This project taps that bus to parse the JSON-encoded messages on CAN IDs `0x649` (system broadcast) and `0x641` (command/response), as well as raw float frames from the outdoor unit, exposing full system state to Home Assistant.

Confirmed working on:
- **Thermostat**: Trane UX360
- **Controller**: Trane SC360
- **System**: Trane ComfortLink II variable-speed heat pump with gas auxiliary heat

Other ComfortLink II systems using the SC360 controller are likely compatible — field reports welcome.

## Features

- **Climate entity** with heat, cool, heat_cool, fan_only, and off modes
- **Presets**: Home, Away, Sleep, Boost
- **Real-time sensors**: outdoor coil temp, compressor demand %, supply air temp, room temp, humidity, setpoints
- **System status**: operating mode, demand stage (HP Stage 1/2, ID Stage 1/2, HP2+ID1/2), run timer, active alarms
- **Fault detection**: captures `IndoorStatus.E` fault strings (e.g. `TA_INV_HI`) as a dedicated text sensor
- **Bidirectional control**: setpoint and mode commands transmitted back on `0x641`
- **Sub-device grouping** (ESPHome 2025.7.0+): entities appear under four logical devices in HA
  - Trane Thermostat UX360
  - Trane SC360 Controller
  - Trane Air Handler
  - Trane Heat Pump

## Hardware

### Required

| Component | Notes |
|---|---|
| M5Stack AtomS3 | ESP32-S3 based, tested and confirmed |
| M5Stack CAN bus module | Plugs directly onto the AtomS3 |
| 24VAC to 5VDC converter | Powers the ESP from the system's 24VAC supply |

Other ESP32-S3 boards with a CAN transceiver should work — adjust `tx_pin` and `rx_pin` in the YAML to match your wiring.

### CAN Bus Connection

Tap the four wires from the ComfortLink II bus at the SC360 or any accessible point in the daisy chain:

| Wire | Signal |
|---|---|
| 24VAC | System power (to 24VAC→5VDC converter) |
| H | CAN High |
| L | CAN Low |
| GND | Ground (common to 24VAC→5VDC converter) |

> ⚠️ The bus runs at **50kbps**. This is configured in the YAML — do not change it.

> ⚠️ Use a dedicated 24VAC→5VDC converter to power the ESP. Do not attempt to power it directly from the 24VAC supply without conversion.

### ESP32 CAN Pin Assignment (M5Stack AtomS3 + CAN module)

```yaml
tx_pin: GPIO5
rx_pin: GPIO6
bit_rate: 50kbps
```

## Decoded CAN Bus Fields

| `ZoneStatus` | `HcStatus` | Heat/cool call: `3`=call active, `4`=satisfied, `5`=elevated call, `7`=aux/emergency |
| `ZoneStatus` | `HoldText` | Schedule/hold text. Schedule names: `WAKE`, `DAY`, `EVENING`, `SLEEP`. Timed hold format: `"Holding Until Today HH:MM"` |

## Operating State Mapping

Cross-referenced against the Trane Home app activity log:

| App state | CAN bus equivalent |
|---|---|
| heat | `HcStatus=3`, `SystemOpStatus.C` = `HP Stage 1/2` or `ID Stage 1/2` |
| cool | `HcStatus=3`, `SystemOpStatus.C` = `Cool Stage` (not yet observed) |
| defrost | `SystemOpStatus.C` = `HP2+ID1` or `HP2+ID2` |
| emergency heating | `HcStatus=7`, `SystemOpStatus.C` = `ID Stage 1/2` |
| fan | `SystemOpStatus.C` = `--`, `IndoorStatus.D` = `B` (blower running post-cycle) |
| idle | `HcStatus=4`, `SystemOpStatus.C` = `--` |
| waiting | `SystemOpStatus.A` = `E` (post-alarm standby/lockout) |

App "Run mode" maps to `SpOverride.HoldType`: hold temp = `2`, run schedule = `0`.

App "Compressor speed" maps directly to `OdStatus.B` (0–100%).

App "Outdoor temperature" maps to `SystemOpStatus.E` (SC360 ambient sensor, float).

## Climate Presets

Setpoints are derived from observed schedule data on a Trane UX360 / SC360 system:

| Preset | Hsp | Csp | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Home | 70°F | 75°F | Typical occupied setpoints |
| Away | 62°F | 85°F | Matches observed zone 2–6 unoccupied values |
| Sleep | 67°F | 72°F | Matches UX360 SLEEP schedule transition |
| Boost | 74°F | 72°F | Raises heat target to encourage aux/gas staging |

Adjust these in `esphome-trane.yaml` under `set_preset_action` to match your schedule.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Fan-only mode** maps to system off (`C`) on the CAN bus — no dedicated fan-only command has been observed yet
- **Heat_cool (auto) mode** sends heat (`A`) — the SC360 manages its own staging between HP and gas automatically
- **Zone 2–6 setpoints** are observable but write support is not yet implemented
- **`0x380` byte layout** has two floats; only the second (outdoor air temp) is confirmed — the first is logged at DEBUG for further investigation

## Contributing

Observations, field mappings, and tested hardware additions are very welcome. If you capture CAN traffic from a different Trane ComfortLink II system please open an issue with your data — field decoding is ongoing.
